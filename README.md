This document is simply to remind me that the first assignment for exdata, which seems so simple now that it's done, made me crazy.

Primary time wasters:

* Figuring out how to concatenate Date and Time to a single POSIX column.
* The plots were easy, but the legends were a pain.  The documentation blows.  Keep the working code as a template.

* Several hours wasted on trying ggplot(), which I never got working.

* Several hours with ddplyr and chaining, until I figured out it works great for reports and plots, but is of no use updating stuff.  Or maybe it is, but not for me.
